					<p>
						Thank you for choosing to host your website with me. Please read the following terms and
						conditions carefully and let me know if you have any questions or concerns:
					</p>

					<p>
						<strong>Acceptable Use:</strong> Your website must comply with all applicable laws and
						regulations, including those related to intellectual property, privacy, and defamation. I
						reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account if you use my services for illegal or
						malicious activities.
					</p>

					<p>
						<strong>Payment:</strong> You are responsible for paying all fees associated with your web
						hosting account. Payment can be made monthly, annually, or on a custom basis as agreed upon
						between you and me. Failure to make timely payments may result in suspension or termination of
						your account.
					</p>

					<p>
						<strong>Content:</strong> You are solely responsible for the content on your website. You must
						ensure that your content does not violate any laws or infringe on the intellectual property
						rights of others. I reserve the right to remove any content that I deem inappropriate or harmful
						to my services or reputation.
					</p>

					<p>
						<strong>Backups:</strong> I make regular backups of the servers, but I cannot guarantee the
						availability or completeness of these backups. You should regularly backup your own data to
						ensure that it is not lost in the event of a server failure or other disaster.
					</p>

					<p>
						<strong>Uptime:</strong> I strive to provide high uptime for my hosting services, but I cannot
						guarantee 100% uptime. Scheduled maintenance and unforeseen events such as natural disasters or
						attacks may result in downtime. I will make every effort to notify you of planned maintenance or
						downtime in advance.
					</p>

					<p>
						<strong>Support:</strong> I provide technical support via email at support@benfeather.dev. I
						will make every effort to resolve technical issues in a timely and professional manner, but I
						cannot guarantee a specific resolution time.
					</p>

					<p>
						<strong>Termination:</strong> Either you or I may terminate your account at any time with or
						without cause. If you terminate your account, you are responsible for any fees due up to the
						termination date. I reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account immediately without
						notice if I believe that you have violated these terms and conditions.
					</p>

					<p>
						<strong>Indemnification:</strong> You agree to indemnify and hold me harmless from any claims,
						damages, or expenses arising from your use of my services, your website content, or your
						violation of these terms and conditions.
					</p>

					<p>
						<strong>Modification:</strong> I reserve the right to modify these terms and conditions at any
						time without prior notice. Your continued use of my services after any modification constitutes
						your acceptance of the modified terms and conditions.
					</p>

					<p>
						<strong>Governing Law:</strong> These terms and conditions are governed by the laws of the
						jurisdiction where our company is located. Any disputes arising from these terms and conditions
						will be resolved in accordance with the laws of that jurisdiction.
					</p>
